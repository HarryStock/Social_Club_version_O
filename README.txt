dev version

superuser                     uses admin for all purposes.
committee and event_persons   use  custom app to insert/update/delete events, whether their own or not, 
members/public                can see events but not make input.

11/10/15 to do:
move unwanted events to archive instead of deleting them.
restrict committee etc to only nadminister their own events
